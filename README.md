# LOK-SABHA-ELECTIONS
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest data analysis project, titled 'Lok Sabha Election'! This project provides insights into Indiaâ€™s Lok Sabha elections from 2014 to 2024, showcasing key trends and patterns in one of the worldâ€™s largest democratic processes.

Hereâ€™s what I worked on:
ðŸ”¹ Data Collection: Acquired comprehensive election data from Kaggle.
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the dataset in Excel for accuracy.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization: Imported the cleaned data into Power BI to create an insightful dashboard report.
ðŸ”¹ Insights: Highlighted real-world election trends and outcomes, offering valuable perspectives.

ðŸ’¡ This project not only honed my skills in data cleaning and visualization but also gave me a deeper understanding of how data can narrate the story of democracy.
